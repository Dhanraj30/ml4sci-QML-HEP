## Introduction

The goal of this project is to explore and develop quantum machine learning models to solve problems in high energy physics. Leveraging the power of quantum computing, we aim to achieve significant advancements in data analysis and simulation for HEP experiments.

## Tasks

The following tasks are part of the project:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the HEP datasets for QML models.
2. **Model Development:** Implement and test various quantum machine learning models.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models using standard metrics.
4. **Experimentation:** Conduct experiments to compare classical ML models with QML models.
5. **Documentation:** Document the code, experiments, and results thoroughly.
## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dhanraj30/ml4sci-QML-HEP.git
    cd ml4sci-QML-HEP
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open the desired notebook from the `notebooks` directory and start exploring the code.
